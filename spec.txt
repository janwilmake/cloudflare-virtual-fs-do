Cloudflare Virtual FS - Specification

Overview:
------------
This project implements a virtual file system using Cloudflare Durable Objects (DOs)
and SQLite as the underlying storage mechanism. The goal is to emulate a traditional
file system API (similar to Node.js's fs module) within a Cloudflare Worker environment,
offering asynchronous file operations that are highly responsive.

Key Features:
------------
1. Two Implementations:
   - Basic Version (fs.ts):
     Implements a simple file system where file content is stored directly.
   - Block-Based Version (blocks.ts):
     Uses a block-based approach to support larger files by splitting file contents
     into fixed-size blocks (default 4KB per block). This allows for handling files
     that are larger than typical size constraints.

2. Directory & File Operations:
   - File write, read, delete operations.
   - Directory creation, listing, and removal.
   - Safe recursive directory creation to ensure all parent directories exist.

3. Durable Object Routing:
   - The first directory component of the file path designates the DO instance.
   - This design provides a scalable way to distribute file operations across multiple
     DOs.

4. Transactional Operations:
   - File operations are wrapped in storage transactions to ensure atomicity and consistency,
     particularly when handling multiple blocks or creating directories.

5. SQLite Schema and Indexing:
   - Uses SQLite to maintain both metadata (file/directory information) and actual file
     content or content blocks.
   - Indexed paths for efficient directory listing and lookup operations.

Usage:
------------
- Deploy using Wrangler with provided configuration in wrangler.toml.
- Access the virtual file system via HTTP endpoints and use the API as illustrated in main.ts.
- The project demonstrates writing, reading, and managing file data along with image retrieval.

Notes:
------------
- This project is experimental and serves as a proof-of-concept; while it has been tested
  with basic operations, further enhancements and error handling may be required for production use.
- The design allows for extension, such as integrating a more feature-rich API or additional file operations.

Future Directions:
------------
- Packaging as an NPM module for wider usage.
- Extending the API to support streaming and partial file updates.
- Enhanced performance optimizations and thorough testing against edge cases.

Happy coding!
